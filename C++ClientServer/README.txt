*client and server created by Benjamin Ellis for the purpose of completing CS371 and graduating on time.*

-My client/server chat functions with both client and server asking the user for ip and port information.
-The server can be initialized to work as localhost (127.0.0.1) and 0.0.0.0. to bind to available IPs.
-The client must input the ip necessary to connect to the server.
-The default port number used for this application was '27015'
-The client can close their connection and end the application with the command '!quit' when chatting.
-Ending the client connection will not close the server.
-This implementation of the client/server utilizes sockets via winsock. This is because sys/socket.h seems
to be a unix based thing and I only have windows machines.

-I feel I should mention that I did not feel as though this course prepared me for this activity much.
Content covered in class had very limited if any actualy code implementation and labs were pretty much unrelated
to this assignment.
